A simple and powerful Streamlit web app that converts any audio file into a video file by combining it with an image, GIF, or video background. Despite the name, the tool supports a variety of formats — it’s not limited to just MP3 or MP4.

The background is looped or trimmed automatically to match the audio’s length, creating a clean and shareable video version of your sound!
